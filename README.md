## Features

1. Downloads and analyzes GitHub Release info to display download links for my projects that exist as executables.

2. Swap the site theme around with the footer links

## Implementation Details

Renders download list and theme buttons with re-frame and Reagent. re-frame is a Flux implementation that supplies a reactive flow template for structuring a ClojureScript app. Reagent is a ClojureScript React wrapper (and more!) that provides great performance while taking care of view updates as you change your application state.
